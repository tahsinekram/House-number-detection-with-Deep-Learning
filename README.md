# House-number-detection-with-Deep-Learning

Had an amazing learning experience implementing a real-time number detection model using Tensorflow and keras in python. Python libraries like pandas and numpy was used to slice and analyse data and h5py for storing the data set used for training. Next, Maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) algorithm was used to extract image segments containing numbers and these were fed into the trained cnn model for classification.
